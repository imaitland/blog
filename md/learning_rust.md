# Rust

My new year's resolution for 2021 has been to learn rust. I've been collecting learning exercises, my thoughts and notes on them here.

## Projects
- A static site generator (i.e this blog!)

## Learning Exercises
- Multi-threaded server implementation
- Parser Combinator
- KV store implementation
- Build your own Lisp (in Rust)
- Rust Linked Lists
