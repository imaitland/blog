# Rust

As I learn Rust I've been collecting exercises, my thoughts and notes on them here.

## Projects
- A static site generator (i.e this blog!)

## Learning Exercises
- Multi-threaded server implementation
- Parser Combinator
- KV store implementation
- Rust Linked Lists
- Build your own Lisp (in Rust)
- [Data Structures](/data_structures)
- [Web Assembly](/wasm)
