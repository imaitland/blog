# Poems

#### Fat Cat

> there's a fat cat on the lawn  
full of his own crotch  
rolling on the scented airs  
purring gently, who cares  
who cares, who cares.  

#### Pro Dancer
> I am a professional dancer.  
> But that does not mean that when I go on holiday I do not dance.  
>
> I went up  onto the dunes just after it had snowed.  
>
> Then I practiced my dance.  
> After a while there was a park ranger and a horse standing behind me on the path.  
> 
> And no matter how hard he tried he could not get the horse to pass me.  
> My dance ended and I let them pass.  
>
> I turned back towards the road and as it became dark,  
> I whooped and holered at the trees.  
> 
> The ranger returned, there was not much happening in the forest,  
> And I let them pass.  

#### Comedian
> Turns out there're a few things you ought not to  
> publicly disparage.  
>
> Like the TSA,  
> or other people’s choices.  
>
> Turns out that  
> sometimes you think  
> you are alone  
> but you are not.  
> 
> like when you’re talking to your dog  
> or riding the bus.
