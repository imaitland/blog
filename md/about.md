# About
My name is iain maitland. I'm a software developer in Baltimore, Md. I've worked at a few startups big and small, and am looking for the next adventure in software engineering. Especially if it's Rust related!

Towards this end, I've been learning Rust, and this website was written in [Rust!](/learning_rust)
