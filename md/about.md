# About
My name is iain maitland. I'm a software developer in Baltimore, Md. I've worked at a few startups big and small over the last 6 years or so as a frontend and then fullstack developer. If you want to keep it formal, my [resume is here](/resume).
git branch -m master main
If you're not a resume reader - and to cut to the gist - I'm interested in builing man-machine and machine-machine interfaces, but more generally making software that does things in the world in creative, crafty and careful ways.

This website was written in [Rust!](/learning_rust), and you can peruse the repo here:

I also enjoy, writing, photography, poetry, [painting](/painting) and memes!

If you'd like to contact me
- Email: hello@iainmaitland.com
- Chat: Join my public room on the [Matrix instance](/chat) that I host.
