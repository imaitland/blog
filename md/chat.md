# Chat 
If you'd like to get a hold of me at short notice, start a correspondence or talk privately. I host a Matrix server at this domain:
matrix.iainmaitland.com
If you install a Matrix client, you can join my public room:
xx yy zz qq. 

If you're curious about hosting a Matrix server yourself, I wrote about my experience.
