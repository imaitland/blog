# Chat 
If you'd like to get a hold of me at short notice, start a correspondence or talk privately. I host a [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) instance at `chat.iainmaitland.com`.

> âš¡ **It's very much in a beta state**, mostly because it's running [conduit.rs](https://conduit.rs/) with some important federation features missing. Nevertheless it's usable you just have to follow these instructions!

- Install a [Matrix client](https://element.io/)
- Create an account on my homeserver instance `chat.iainmaitland.com` 

  > **Important** the client will typically default to creating an account at `username:matrix.org` don't do this!
- Once you have created your account - something like `username:chat.iainmaitland.com` you can login and chat with me!
